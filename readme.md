# Axis Camera Workshop Repository - Pink Sunday

In this workshop, I had the chance to work with  two other  participants to assemble a classic Axis camera and explore its core functionalities, including motion detection, audio analytics, and image processing. We learnt basic Python programming and gain hands-on experience with Axis network video devices.
